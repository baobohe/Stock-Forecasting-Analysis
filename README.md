# Stock-Forecasting-Analysis

## Featured Analysis

- `closed price.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook is a comprehensive analysis of the closing stock prices for Apple Inc. (AAPL), utilizing the `AAPL.csv` dataset. The following points detail the depth and breadth of my approach:

  - **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Demonstrating meticulous attention to detail, the notebook begins with a thorough data cleaning process, handling missing values, anomalies, and normalizing the data where appropriate.

  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: I conducted an extensive EDA, leveraging statistical summaries and visualization techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and distributions within the closing price data.

  - **Moving Average Computation**: To smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends, I computed and analyzed simple and exponential moving averages.

  - **Time-Series Decomposition**: Employing time-series decomposition, I isolated and examined seasonal trends, cyclic patterns, and residuals to understand the underlying structure of the stock's movement.

  - **Forecasting**: Using ARIMA models, I projected future stock prices based on historical data, showcasing my capability in predictive analytics.

  - **Visualization**: The notebook contains a variety of visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn, providing clear and insightful views into the data's behavior.

  - **Statistical Testing**: I performed hypothesis testing to validate assumptions and conclusions, reflecting a rigorous approach to data analysis.
